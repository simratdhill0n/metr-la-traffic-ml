# METR-LA Traffic Speed Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data
analysis and builds a machine learning model to predict traffic speed using
the METR-LA dataset.

The work is part of a research screening task and focuses on clear analysis,
sound modeling decisions, and reproducibility.
